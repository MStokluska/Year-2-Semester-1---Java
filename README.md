# Year-2-Semester-1---Java
This is my final programming project for semester 1 of year 2 at Waterford Institute of Technology BSc in Information Technology

This programme was created using Eclipse.

Programme purpose:
This is a programme that can have multiple software users and each software user can have their own database of fans, players or 
subscribers. Also, each user can specify what values the users are allowed to have except for name, surname and age which pre-programmed
attributes. Programme is persistent and saves linked lists in .txt format relatively, so does not need access permissions.


How to:
1. User has to create Software User in order to log in and use the software
2. During creation of the user, name, surname and age must be specified, also, user has to choose 4 random attributes that he would like
his registered users ( that he will be able to add to the programme) have, example: Address, Country, Phone Number, Name of next of kin.
3. User also has to type in name of the club he is interested in and select club type, Sport Club, Fun Club or Subscribers Database
4. Once all fields are filled in and selected user can click on 'Create User'
5. Now using own credentials user can log in and main widnow of the programme opens, depending on club type, user will see different 
type of Jbuttons, background image as well as name of the club.
6. Options are to add users, delete users, view/edit users, view age statistics, display all users, log out and exit
7. Each software user can have their own database of users of different clubs and club types.
8. Software is using persistency so once software users are added they will stay there until manually removed
9. Programme is using relative paths to save different types of linked list so it does not need access permissions.
